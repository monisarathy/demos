HOW IT WORKS 

The project identifies inefficiencies in energy usage across systems.

Uses AI and IoT to optimize energy consumption dynamically.

Real-time data is collected, monitored, and visualized to support smart decisions.

Energy savings are achieved through efficient model inference and secure communication protocols.


DATA COLLECTION 

Dataset collected from online sources such as Kaggle, Google datasets, and IoT device logs.

Data included energy metrics before and after optimization.

Additional testing data generated through simulations.# demos
